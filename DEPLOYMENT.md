## Post-Deployment

### Testing
- [ ] Visit deployed frontend URL

- [ ] Add a test bookmark
- [ ] Verify AI summary appears
- [ ] Test regenerate summary
- [ ] Test delete bookmark
- [ ] Test logout and login
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Test in different browsers

### Firebase Configuration
- [ ] Add production domain to Firebase authorized domains:
  - Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains
  - Add your Vercel/Netlify domain

### Performance
- [ ] Check page load speed (use Lighthouse)
- [ ] Verify images load correctly
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test with slow network (Chrome DevTools)

### Security
- [ ] Verify Firebase rules are production-ready
- [ ] Check CORS settings on backend
- [ ] Ensure no API keys exposed in frontend code
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Verify user data isolation

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (optional: Sentry)
- [ ] Monitor backend logs
- [ ] Check Firebase usage quotas
- [ ] Monitor Gemini API usage

## Production Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)
```env
PORT=10000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_key
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### Frontend Environment Variables
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_DB_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

## Firebase Production Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid",
        "bookmarks": {
          "$bookmarkId": {
            ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['url', 'title', 'summary', 'createdAt'])"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Deployment Issues

### Backend won't start
- âœ… Check environment variables are set correctly
- âœ… Verify `npm install` completed successfully
- âœ… Check build logs for errors
- âœ… Ensure Node.js version compatibility

### Frontend shows "Cannot connect to server"
- âœ… Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to deployed backend
- âœ… Check backend is running (visit `/api/health`)
- âœ… Verify CORS is enabled on backend
- âœ… Check browser console for CORS errors

### Firebase auth errors
- âœ… Add production domain to Firebase authorized domains
- âœ… Verify Firebase config in environment variables
- âœ… Check Firebase project is in production mode

### AI summaries not working
- âœ… Verify Gemini API key is valid
- âœ… Check API usage limits
- âœ… Review backend logs for errors

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Keep local version running** - Your local setup still works
2. **Check deployment logs** - Most platforms show detailed error logs
3. **Revert to previous deployment** - Most platforms have rollback feature
4. **Fix issues locally** - Test fix locally before redeploying

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

âœ… Users can register and login  
âœ… Bookmarks can be added  
âœ… AI summaries generate correctly  
âœ… Real-time updates work  
âœ… Mobile experience is good  
âœ… No console errors  
âœ… Page loads in < 3 seconds  
âœ… All features work as expected  

## Next Steps After Deployment

- [ ] Share the app with friends for feedback
- [ ] Monitor usage and errors
- [ ] Plan feature enhancements
- [ ] Consider adding analytics
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Add to portfolio/resume

## Cost Estimates

### Free Tier Limits
- **Firebase**: 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day, 1GB storage
- **Gemini API**: 15 requests/minute, 1500 requests/day
- **Render**: 750 hours/month (enough for 1 app)
- **Vercel**: 100GB bandwidth, 6000 build minutes
- **Netlify**: 100GB bandwidth, 300 build minutes

For typical personal use, everything should stay within free tiers!

**Good luck with your deployment! ðŸš€**
